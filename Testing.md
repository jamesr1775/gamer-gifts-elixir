    - were ran on chrome and firefox.
    - were repeated on various screen resolutions using the chrome and firefox developer tools that include desktops, ipad, ipad pro, iphone X, 5, 6 ,7 , 8 and the plus models.
    - were repeated on the developers own smartphone (samsung) and tablet (ipad), desktop and laptop.

#### Site Header & Hero Image
##### Device Specific Layout Checks
- The Header responsiveness was tested by varying the screen size to see that the logo and navbar links were responsive and also that the navbar becomes an expandable burger icon on smartphones and tablets.
- The logo stays to the left of the header on all screens with the my account and basket links to the right of the page.
- The website navigation links should be under the logo, the account and the basket links on large screens. When the burger icon is clicked the links should be on the left side of the screen.

##### Site Header Tests
- The logo was tested that when it is pressed it returns / refreshes to the home page.
